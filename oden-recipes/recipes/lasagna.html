    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped,
        thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants.</p>
    <p> It's typically cooked with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables,
        cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices with the other
        ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked
        pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh spinach</li>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 pinch dried basil</li>
        <li>1 cup pasta sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish with cooking spray.
            Set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place spinach in the water and boil until wilted and
            tender, about 2 minutes. Remove spinach with a slotted spoon, pressing out excess water. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook lasagna in the same boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite,
            about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Mix spinach, ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, egg, nutmeg, basil, salt, and black pepper
            in a bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/4 cup pasta sauce on the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of
            the ricotta-egg mixture, and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. Repeat layers of 3 more noodles, 1/2 cup ricotta-egg
            mixture, and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. End with remaining 3 noodles and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. Sprinkle with
            remaining 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese. Top with Parmesan cheese. Cover casserole with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Uncover casserole and continue baking until lasagna is bubbling
            and lightly browned, about 25 more minutes. Let lasagna stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
